The goal of this assignment is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This submission includes: 
1) a tidy data set, 
2) a link to a Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) A README.md in the repo that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Relevant Project Files included:
1. "run_analysis.R": The R Script that performs the analysis described in the Codebook.md. 
2. "CodeBook.md": code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data. 
3. "TidyDataset.txt": The resulting tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
4. "README.txt": explans connection between the files. 
5. UCI HAR Dataset files



Data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The UCI HAR dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
